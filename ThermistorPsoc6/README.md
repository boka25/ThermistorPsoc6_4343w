# PSoC 6 MCU: ADC Using HAL

This code example demonstrates the use of the [ADC HAL](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/mtb-hal-cat1/html/group__group__hal__adc.html) driver to perform voltage measurements. In this example, the ADC HAL driver is configured to sample input voltage periodically and display the sampled voltage on the UART. By default, the ADC is configured to use one channel in single ended mode.
This example also demonstrates the multichannel configuration of the ADC HAL driver, which performs asynchronous reads from multiple channels. In this case, two channels are used. The first channel is configured in single-ended mode and the second channel is configured in differential mode.

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

**Note:** PSoC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit (CY8CPROTO-062-4343W) uses pins 10_1 and 10_2 as ADC inputs for the multichannel configuration example. By default, these pins are connected to the thermistor output on the board. To use these pins as ADC inputs, remove resistors R36 and R37. For more information, see the [PSoC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit Guide](https://www.cypress.com/file/457891/download).

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In Command-line Interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In Third-party IDEs</b></summary>

1. Follow the instructions from the **In Command-line Interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

</details>

## Operation

If using a PSoC 64 Secure MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC 64 Secure MCU must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the [Secure Boot SDK User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

   **Note:** By default, this application uses the single-channel configuration. In this configuration, one ADC channel is configured in single-ended mode and the channel input is configured to analog input pin P10_0. This application also supports multichannel configuration where two channels are configured; one channel is configured in single-ended mode with input from the analog input pin P10_0, and the second channel configured in differential mode with the two inputs Vplus and Vref mapped to P10_1 and P10_2 respectively. To use the multichannel configuration, modify the `ADC_EXAMPLE_MODE` macro to `MULTI_CHANNEL`.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
      </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
</details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Ensure that input voltages are provided at analog input pins P10_0 if single channel configuration is chosen. Confirm that "PSoC 6 MCU: ADC using HAL"  and the input voltage is displayed on the UART terminal.

    **Figure 1. Terminal Output with Single-Channel Configuration**

    ![ Terminal output with single channel](images/single-channel-output.png)

5. If multichannel configuration is chosen, ensure that the input voltage is provided at analog input pins P10_0 and P10_1. Provide a reference voltage to the second channel at the analog input pin P10_2. Confirm that "PSoC 6 MCU: ADC using HAL"  and the input voltages from the two channels are displayed on the UART terminal.

    **Figure 2. Terminal Output with Multichannel Configuration**

    ![Terminal output with multichannel configuration](images/multichannel-output.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and Implementation

In this example, the ADC is configured with 12-bit resolution; by default, one channel with 0-VDDA range is configured using HAL. The input voltage is sampled every 200 ms by calling `cyhal_adc_read_uv`; the measured input voltage is displayed on UART terminal.

This example also supports multichannel configuration. Multichannel configuration can be used by changing the macro `SINGLE_CHANNEL` to `false`. The ADC is configured to use two channels; Channel 0 is configured in single-ended mode, while Channel 1 is configured in differential mode. The `cyhal_adc_read_async_uv` API function is used to read the results from the two channels asynchronously.

This code example uses a delay of 200 ms between reads for demonstration purpose to print the sampled results on the UART. To achieve sampling at higher rates, remove the delay and use the  `cyhal_adc_set_sample_rate` API function to configure the number of samples per second.

PSoC 6 HAL currently restricts mapping of any GPIO pins as input to the ADC. Only pins that have direct connection to the ADC can be used as inputs to the ADC. On all the supported boards, P10_x are the preferred GPIO pins as the input for the ADC because they directly connect to the ADC; therefore, the input pin P10_1 is used as the input for the first channel, and pins P10_1 and P10_2 are used for the second channel.
